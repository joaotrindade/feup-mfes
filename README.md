T12. Smart Power Grids

The goal of this practical work is to develop, test, check and document an executable formal model of a critical or high-integrity software system in VDM++ using the Overture tool. 
At the end of this work, students should have acquired the capability of formally modeling software systems in VDM++.

Specify in VDM++ a control system for a smart electrical power grid. 
You have to investigate the requirements of such controler (cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid).
Pay special attention to desiderata such as redundancy, power flux (the amount of power that can traverse some lines), power losses (over distance), home generation, scheduling (one cannot turn simply turn off a main generator during the night), absence of generalized energy storage, etc.
